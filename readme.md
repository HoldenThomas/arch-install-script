# Arch Installer
Enter these commands to get started:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HoldenThomas/arch-install-script/main/install > install
sh install
```

This script installs the base arch system with the configurations I use.
After rebooting into the fresh install the script can be run again to install a aur helper (yay), my dotfiles, and any applications I use.
