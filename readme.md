# Arch Installer
Enter these commands to get started:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HoldenThomas/arch-install-script/main/install.sh > install.sh
sh install.sh
```

This script installs the base arch system with the configurations I use.
After rebooting into the fresh install the script can be run again to install a aur helper (yay), my dotfiles, and any applications I use.

This includes:
- xorg
- pulseaudio
- bluetooth
- fonts
- themes
- notifications
- file system utilities
- zsh
- neovim
- i3
- Password keyring
- some other gui and terminal appliacations
